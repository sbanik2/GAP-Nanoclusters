</p>

This repository contains **Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP)** models for **54 elemental nanocluster systems** across the periodic table. For each element, the following are provided:

* GAP potential model files
* Tersoff potential files for comparison
* Performance metrics and dataset statistics
* Energy and force parity plots
* Results of dynamic stability tests
* Normal mode analysis
* Lattice parameter and cohesive energy ordering of ground state polytypes
* Comparison of energy and force errors with Tersoff models [Manna *et al.* (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27849-6)
* Lattice parameter and cohesive energy prediction comparisons

This resource aims to support the development, benchmarking, and evaluation of machine-learning interatomic potentials against traditional models in low-dimensional nanocluster systems.

## Dataset


The training and test datasets are made available **upon request**.

The **ground state polymorphs** of the elemental nanoclusters and a portion of the **validation dataset** are publicly accessible via the [Quantum Cluster Database (QCD)](https://muellergroup.jhu.edu/qcd/).

Additionally, all QCD configurations **relaxed using the GAP model** are provided in this repository under the `qcd_gap_relaxed/` directory.

## Usage

### Relaxing Structures with GAP

This example demonstrates how to relax a nanocluster structure using a trained **Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP)** model via the **[QUIP](https://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/)** interface and **[ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)**.

The script below performs a geometry optimization (relaxation) on a single `.xyz` structure using the GAP model:

```python
from ase.io import read, write
from ase.optimize import BFGS
from quippy.potential import Potential

# --- Settings ---
element = "Ag"  # Replace with your element symbol
structure_path = f"{element}_structure.xyz"  # Input structure file
gap_file = f"./gap_files/{element}.xml"      # Path to the GAP model file

# --- Read structure ---
atoms = read(structure_path)

# --- Assign GAP calculator ---
gap_calc = Potential(param_filename=gap_file)
atoms.calc = gap_calc

# --- Relaxation using BFGS optimizer ---
optimizer = BFGS(atoms, logfile=None)
optimizer.run(fmax=0.001, steps=500)

# --- Output results ---
relaxed_energy = atoms.get_potential_energy()
print(f"Relaxed GAP energy: {relaxed_energy:.6f} eV")
```

### ðŸ“Œ Requirements

* `ase`
* `quippy` (install via QUIP or conda build of `libatoms`)

Absolutely. Here's a generalized version of the **LAMMPS input script** with a clean format for a general audience, suitable for placing in your `README.md` under the LAMMPS usage section:

### Using GAP with LAMMPS

To perform structure relaxation with a GAP model in LAMMPS, use the following template. Ensure your **[LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0)**  build includes the **QUIP interface**.

```lammps
dimension       3
units           metal
boundary        f f f
atom_style      atomic    

read_data       structure.geo   # Replace with your LAMMPS data file


pair_style      quip
pair_coeff      * * path/to/your_gap_model.xml "Potential xml_label=Your_Label" atomic_number

neighbor        2.0 bin
neigh_modify    every 2 delay 0 check no

# Minimization
minimize        1.0e-10 1.0e-10 10000 10000

write_data      relaxed_structure.data
```

### Using Tersoff-HyBOP Potentials in LAMMPS

The Tersoff-HyBOP model used here consists of **two components**:

* A **Tersoff-style (BOP-like)** three-body interaction potential
* A **Lennard-Jones (LJ) scaling** component for long-range dispersion interactions

All model parameters are stored in individual `.json` files per element . Each file includes:

* A `tersoff` section with named Tersoff parameters
* A `scaling` section with `epsilon`, `sigma`, `k1`, `k2`, and `RcLR` used in `lj/cut/scaling`

To convert these `.json` files into **LAMMPS-ready inputs**, use the Jupyter notebook:

> ðŸ““ `tersoff_lammps_template.ipynb`

This notebook automates:

* Generating the `.tersoff` file used with `pair_style tersoff`
* Writing a matching `LAMMPS input script (.in)` that uses `hybrid/overlay` with `tersoff` and `lj/cut/scaling` styles.

---

####  LAMMPS Setup example:

```lammps
pair_style hybrid/overlay tersoff lj/cut/scaling 14
pair_coeff * * tersoff Ag.tersoff Ag
pair_coeff 1 1 lj/cut/scaling epsilon sigma k1 k2 RcLR
```

Make sure to replace the last line with the actual values, which are automatically extracted by the script.
